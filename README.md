## Installation
1. Download the [latest](https://github.com/SchoofsEbert/Touch-Tab-Tab/releases/latest/download/Touch-Tab-Tab.zip) `Touch-Tab-Tab.zip` from [Releases](https://github.com/ris58h/Touch-Tab/releases) page.
2. Unzip the archive and move `Touch-Tab-Tab.app` into the `Applications` folder.
3. The app is ad-hoc signed so when you run the app macOS will warn you: `"Touch-Tab-Tab" can’t be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software`. Right-click the app and click `Open`, a
pop-up will appear, click `Open` again.
4. The app needs access to global trackpad events. Allow Touch-Tab-Tab to control your computer in `System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accesibility`. If you had Touch-Tab-Tab installed before you may need to remove Touch-Tab-Tab from the `Accessibility` list first and add it again.
5. Disable 3-finger swipe between full-screen apps or make it 4-finger in `System Settings > Trackpad > More Gestures > Swipe between full-screen apps`.

## Usage
- Use 3-fingers swipe right or 3-fingers swipe left to switch between tabs.

### Hide Status Bar Item
Holding ⌘ drag the item away from the status bar until you see ✖️ (cross icon) then let it go. To recover the item just open the app one more time.

## Troubleshooting
### "Touch-Tab-Tab" can’t be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software
Right-click the app and click `Open`, a pop-up will appear, click `Open` again.
### It's running but doesn't work
- Check that Touch-Tab-Tab is allowed to control your computer in `System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accesibility`.  If you had Touch-Tab-Tab installed before you may need to remove Touch-Tab-Tab from the `Accessibility` list first and add it again.
- Check that 3-finger swipe is disabled in `System Settings > Trackpad > More Gestures > Swipe between full-screen apps`.
### It still doesn't work
